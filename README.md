# ModdScript

ModdScript is based upon JavaScript. ModdScript starts off with triggers in the format of `@trigger`. Following the trigger, content for the actual script can be put.

When finished with your code, you can copy the JSON output of your ModdScript and paste it into the JSON view of a script, which will automatically be converted to default Modd blocks when you switch back to Tree View.
